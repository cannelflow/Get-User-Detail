    // initialize XMLHttpRequest object
    var abc = new XMLHttpRequest();
    //The xhr variable will now be the gateway to all the various properties 
    //and methods the XMLHttpRequest object provides for allowing you to make web 
    //requests. One such method is open. 
    abc.open("Get", "http://ipinfo.io/json", true);
    //So far, what we've done is initialized the XMLHttpRequest object and 
    //constructed our request. We haven't sent the request out yet, but that 
    //is handled by the next line:
    abc.send();
    //we need is a way to send our request and then be notified of when the request comes 
    //back so that our code can finish what it started.
    abc.addEventListener("readystatechange", processRequest, false);
    //This line looks like any other event listening code you've written a 
   // bunch of times. We listen for the readystatechange event on our xhr object and call 
    // the processRequest event handler when the event gets overheard. Here is where some fun stuff happens!
    //We have our event listener all ready, and all we need is the processRequest 
    //event handler where we can add some code to read the result that gets returned. 
    //Let's go ahead and first add our event handler:
    //Since our goal is to read the returned value after our request has been 
    //completed, the readyState value of 4 is our friend. We need to ensure we only move forward 
    //when this value is set, so here is what the modified processRequest function would look like to handle that:
    function processRequest(e) {
        if (abc.readyState == 4 && abc.status == 200) {
            var response = JSON.parse(abc.responseText);
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = response.ip+"<br>"+response.hostname+"<br>"+response.city+"<br>"+response.region;
           // alert(response.ip);
        }
    }
    //In plain English, what this check does is simple. This if statement 
    //checks that the request has completed (readyState == 4) AND is successful (status == 200). 
    //Only if both of those conditions are met can we declare that our request did what we wanted it to do.
